/**
 * Resolves a CMS image field to a URL the site can actually serve.
 *
 * Why this exists: the media store is git-based (`public/`), so image fields
 * are authored as relative paths like `images/soluciones/x.webp`. At build time
 * (SSR) that raw value is used and resolves to `/images/...` correctly. But on
 * the deployed site `useTina()` re-fetches from Tina Cloud, which rewrites those
 * fields to absolute CDN URLs like `https://assets.tina.io/<id>/images/...`.
 * Prepending `BASE_URL` to that absolute URL produced `/https://assets.tina.io/...`
 * → 404 (see the solution-category, home 3D cover and testimonial avatars).
 *
 * Fix: normalize back to the LOCAL asset. Whatever Tina returns, extract the
 * `images/...` segment and serve it from our own `public/` folder. That keeps
 * SSR and client output identical and never depends on Tina's CDN.
 *
 * Truly external URLs (e.g. an Unsplash `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-...`,
 * which has no `images/` path segment) are left untouched.
